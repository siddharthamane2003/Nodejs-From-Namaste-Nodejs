In COMPONEY the project are build using WATER FOLL MODEL
STGES ARE REQUIREMTS -> DESIGN -> DEVLPING -> TESTING -> DEPLOYMENT -> MAINTAEINCE
REURIUMENTS -> UNDREATSING PROBLEM STATMENT , GET THE ALL REQIREMTS WHUCH NEEDS TO DEVOPMENT. WHIHC TECH STACK CHOOSE.
DEGIEN -> DESGN THE ARITCUTE OF PROJECT.
DEVEPLOMENT -> DEV THE PROJECT. WRITE THE TEST CASES.
TESTING -> TEST THE TEST CASES.
DEPLOYMENT -> DEPLOY THE PROJECT.
MAINTENCE -> IF ANY REUQRMENT THEN RE-PERFOM ALL PROCESS.

MONOLITH VS MICROSERVIES

MONOLITH -> ONE PROJECT/REPO HAVE THE FRONT END , BACK END , TESTING ALL PROJECT
MICROSERVIES -> SMALL SMALL PROJECTS. LIKE FRONT END , BACK END , TESTING SEPARTE SEPRATE.
SERVIES/PROJECT/APPCIATION-> SERVIES MEANS SMALL PROJECT.

MONOLITH VS MICROSERVIES

MONOLITH ->

- devploment speed fast.
- only one repo
- scalblity higth , hight storge.
- DEVPLOMENT OF MAINTNCE IS LESS.
- ONLY ONE TECH STACK.
- COST IS LESS.
- COMPLIXITY IS LES.
- TESTING HIGHT

MICROSERVIES->

- devploment speed SLOW.
- NO. OF repoS.
- TESTING IS LESS.
- scalblity LESS , LESS storge.
- DEVPLOMENT OF MAINTNCE IS HIGHT.
- MANY TECH STACK.
- COST IS HOIGHT
- COMPLIXITY IS HIGHT.

We are using the microserves buliding projects as the FRONT END , BACK END.
