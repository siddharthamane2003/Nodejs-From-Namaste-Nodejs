DATABASE -> ORGASINSED OR STRCTURED COLLECTION OF DATA.
DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - THESE IS SOFTWARE.
- IT WILL INTRACT TO DATABASE AND APLLICTION.
 IT WILL DO OPARTION ON DATA LIKE THE FETCH , DELETE , PUSH.
- IT LOSLY TYPE OF DATABASE AS SERVER.

1. TYPES OF DATABASE -
RELATIONAL DB  - MYSQL , POSTGRASQL  (WE USE).
NOSQL DB - MONGODB  (WE USE).
CLOUD DATABAE.
NO OF TYPES OF DATABSE.

DEPEND ON COMPONCY , PERSON WHICH TYPE OF DATABASE THEY ARE USED.
- EACH DATABASE HAVE THE PROS AND CONS.

2. RELATION DATA BASE=
- 1970 & 1980 IN WILL INTRODUED.
- EF CODD - INTERODUCED CODD 12 RULES
- IF THES FOLLWO 12 RULES THEN THESE IS RELATIONAL DATBASE.
- MICAL WINDENIUM INVENTED MYSQL.
- MICAL STONEBREKER - INVENTED POSTGRASE SQL

- SQL -> STRUCTURE QUERY LAGUGAGE.
            ->  WHEN WE HAVE TO INTARCT TO DATBASE.
            -> QUERY IS WAY OF INTARCTION AS PUT , DELETE , ADD LIKE. FOR THE SQL IS USED.

- NO SQL (NOT ONLY SQL)
 - TYPES OF NO SQL ->
 - KEY VALUE DB
 - GRAPH BD
 - WIDE 
 - MULTIDEL BD
 - DOCUMENT DATABSE (MONGO DB) (WE USE)



RELACTION DATABASE MANAGEMENT VS NO SQL.
- RDBMS -> DATA ARE STORED IN ROW & COLUMN IN MATRIX.
        -> ONE TABLE HAVE THE ROW & COLUMS HAVE EACH COL HAVE THE SEPRATE PROPERTIES AS THE NAME , ID , CELL , CITY.
        IF I WANT ADD THE EXTRA COLUMN AS THE LOC THEN WE CANNOT ADD DIRECTLY. WE HAVE NEED JOIN OPRATION
        SO FOR THAT WE HAVE TO CREATE THE NEW MATIX HAVE THE SAME ID THEN WE ADD INTO THE LOC.
        -> TWO MATRIX THEY ARE RELETD TO EACH OTHER.

MONOGO DB -> DATA ARE IN COLLECTION.
          -> {
            P1:KCBJS
            P2:KJDB
          }
          THESE CALLED DOCUMNET.
          -> WE DO NEDD JOIN , DATA NORMAZAION.
          -> WHY THESE EASY.
  
DIFF BETWEEN RELATION DATBASE (MYSQL) VS NOSQL(MONGODB) REFER FROM THE SCREENSHOT.
