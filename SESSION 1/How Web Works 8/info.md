Server - It will handle no.of requtes from extrnal device/USER.

1. Hardware as Server -> - Hardware have the ram , rom, file , no.of data. - We have to acess these ram ,rom. - We are sending no.of requests to hardare.
   sol: we build the application in our software which will handle requtes. - AWS - IT will handle the hardware.

2. Limitation of our software as server - we also use our com as sever but it have some limitations. -
             1. Limites Storage. 2. Internt Connection.

3. HARDWARE WILL HIRE AWS AND IT MANAGE/HANDLE THE HARDARE THE STORGE , INTERNET CONNECTION ETC.

4. SOFWATER AS SERVER - WE BULID APPLICATION IT HAVE THE NO OF REQUTS FROM THE USRES. - SO WE HANDLE IT - SO OUR APPLCTION IS SERVER.

DEPENDS ON THE CONEXT WE ARE TALKIG AS THE Hardware as Server / APPLCTION IS SERVER.
IN AWA NO. OF HARDAWRE WILL MANGE HAVE THE DATACENTER.
EX -> NAMSTE.DEV HAVE THE SEVER IN THE PUNE.

5. - CLIENT WHICH ARE SENDING REQUESTS TO SERVER.
   - CLIENT HAVE THE COMPUTER IN WEB IT WILL REQUESTING.
   - EVRY COMPUTER HAVE THE IP ADRESS.
   - IT PASS REQUESTS MEANS IT WILL SOKECTS CONNECTION TO SEVER.
   - SRVER TAKES REQUETS ACCORDIGLY WHICH TAKS WILL EXCUTES.
   - AND IT WILL RETRUNS THE RESULT.
   - SOKECT CONNECTION WILL END.
   - NO. OF CLINET WILL MAKES REQUETS TO THE SEVER IT WILL HADLE IT.
   - AFTER THE DONE PROCESS SOKET CONNCTION END.
   - IT WILL DONE BY THE TCP/IP
   - PROTOCOL ? -> IT WILL RULES WAY OF COMMUNCIATION.
   EX-> I HIND WE BOTH PREFER TO TALKL LIKE THAT.
  - HTTP , HTTPS , SMTP THESE ARE PROTCOLS. THESE ARE LAGUAGE WE ARE COMMUCTION.
  - THE HTTP PROTOCOLS ARE THE server Will SEND RESPONCE.
  - WE ARE USING HTTP SERVER FOR THE COMMUNICATION TO CLIENT.
  - ON THE OUR SEVER THE HTTP SERVER WILL SENDING THE RESPONCE.
  - HTTP BASCILY ARE TEXT , JSON TEXT , COMMON TEXT WE ARE PASSING.
  - HTTP SEVER WILL SENDS THE RESPONCE IN PACKETS.
  - MEANS SMALL SMALL CHUKS.
  - TCP/IP WILL SENDS THE PACKET IN CHUKS.


- TCP/IP ->WILL SENDS THE PACKET IN CHUKS TO THE CLINET
- HTTP PROTOCOL - LAGUAGE OF COMMUNCTION.
- HTTP SWRVER -> LISTESN THE REQUESTS. OUR APLLICATION
- PACKTES ->  DATA TO SENDING THE CLIENT.
- SOKECT CONNECTION -> THESE LIKE ARROW TO CONNECT TO SEVER AND CLINET.
- WHEN OUR SENDING REQUEST AND GIVES THE RESPONCE IS FINISHED THEN SOKECT CONNECTION WILL STOPS/FINSHESWILL SENDS THE PACKET IN CHUKS.


6. BEFOR THESE ALL HAPPENS THE 
 CLIENT WILL TYPES THE URL THEN IT WILL GOES TO THE DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM).
 - THEN DNS WILL GIVE THE IP.
 THEN IT WILL SEND THE REQUEST TO THE OUR SEVER THEN PROCESS WILL CONTIOUNE.

7. - WE HAVE THE MUPLIRE SEVER IN OUR SERVER MEASN WE CAN DEVELOPE THE NO. OF APPLICATIONS.
   - PORT -> SO FOR THE IDETIFINCATION WE HAVE USE PORT.
   - PORT WILL DIFFERTIATE THE HTTP SERVERS
   - PATH-> IN OUR APPLICATION NO.OF PAGE THAT WE HAVE TO USE THE SPECIFIC PAGE SO FOR THAT WE HAVE TO USE THE PATH.

   EX-> http://www.w3schools.com/js -> www.w3schools.com -> IP  -> HTTP SERVER (DOMAIN NAME)
   /-> PORT NUMNER -> SPECIF APPLIACTION
   JS-> PATH OF SPECIF PAAGE

   http://www.w3schools.com/js/userpage
    http://www.w3schools.com -> IP
    js -> PORT NUMBER
    userpage -> PATH

8. - IN MNC COMPONEY WE MEATIN SEPRTE SEPEATE SERVER FOR FRONT END , BACK END , DATA BASE ETC.
   - SOKET VS WEB SOCEKT
     SOKET WILL SEND THE REQUEST AND IT GETS THE RESPONCE AND END THE SOKET.
   - WEB SOKECT -> SEND THE REQUETS AND GEST THE RESPOCEN AND 
   THE CONNECTION WILL STAYS LONG TIME.
   - BUT THEIR ARE MUIPLE REQUEST AND IT WILL HOLD THE CONNECTION THEN ITS NOT OPTMASTC. 

9. THE HTTP SEVER MEANS APPLICATION NOT THE MACHINE/COMPUTER.

10. NORMAL WAY ERITING JS WILL NOT OPTMIATC , NOT  FAST ,Routing becomes messy, Hard to scale for big apps.

WE CAN USE EXPRESS FOR FAST CRAETING SERVER.
